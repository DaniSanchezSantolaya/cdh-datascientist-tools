The ADM Datamart is an open database schema where the ADM models and all predictors are copied into. The standard
ADM reports both in Analytics Center as well as in the Report Browser (Adaptive category) work off this schema.

Since the schema is open we can also use it to create our own reports and support things not available in the OOTB
reporting in Pega.
